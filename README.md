# AoAWikiHelperMod
Helper mod for the Advent of Ascension Wiki

Feel free to contribute via pull-requests to the project. Open to community contributions.


This mod was made to make some automated functions to help with editing and updating the AoA wiki.
The idea being that if we can have this tool automatically print out information for the wiki in an already-formatted layout, it will be much quicker updating individual pages.
It should also help with consistent formatting and editing standards.

All actions in-game are handled via the **/wikihelper** command and its subcommands.
